Project list:

## Query Types

Maybe:

1. Query returns no rows -> complete.

2. Query exist a row -> trigger `onSuccess` and complete.

3. Query result update after query complete -> nothing happens.

Single:

1. Query returns not rows -> trigger `onError(EmptyResultSetException::class)`.

2. Query exist a row -> trigger `onSuccess`.

3. Query result update after `Single.onComplete` was called -> nothing happens.

Flowable:

1. Query returns no rows -> emit, neither `onNext`, nor `onError`.

2. Query exist a row -> trigger `onNext`.

3. Query result update after query complete -> emit automatically, allow you to update the UI based on the latest data.
